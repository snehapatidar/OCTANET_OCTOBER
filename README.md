# OCTANET_OCTOBER
In this repository i submitted my all task of OCTANET internship.
1st Task :-
my 1st task was to create a landing page of website.
so i chose to create a landing page of MANGO INDIA Online shopping website.

2nd Task :-
my 2nd task was to create "TO DO LIST" website.
In this To Do list we can add our task list and mark that task as completed or incomplete. We can write the new task in the input box and click on the "Add" button then the new task will be added to the list.
We can click on the task name to mark it as completed or incomplete task. i  added a cross icon to delete the particular task from the ToDo list.
In this JavaScript Project i used Local Storage  that will store the task list or To Do list in your web browser, So that if you cross and restart the browser then also it will display your saved To-Do List
